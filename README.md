# Research Question:
Does adding an automatic tutorial session to the app improve user engagement compared to the original version without the tutorial?

# Control Group
- Users who receive the original version of the app, without the tutorial session.
- Size: 31 + 4 users
- Acts as a baseline to measure how users normally engage with the app.

# Treatment Group
- Users who receive the new version of the app, which includes an automatic tutorial session that walks them through how to use the app.
- Size: 31 + 4 users
- To test whether the tutorial improves user engagement compared to the baseline.

# Randomization
We randomly shuffled the full sample of n users and divided them equally into two groups (n/2 users each).
•	Group A received an email with a link for the original version of the app (without the tutorial).
•	Group B received an email with a link for the new version of the app (with the tutorial feature).
This random assignment helps ensure that any differences in user engagement between the two groups are due to the tutorial feature, not pre-existing differences among users.
